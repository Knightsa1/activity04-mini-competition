**I looked a the variables to see what they meant.**

**My interpretation of the question is that parents want to know what they can do to help their children do better in school. Looking at my variables I'm wondering if we should keep all the variables. For example in my set there was child's birth month and child's birth year. These are not things that the parent can change and I'm wondering if they belong in the data set.**

```{r}
summary(data)
```

**After looking at the documentation I saw that everything was basically on a scale of like 1-5.**

**I think that ' SEGRADES ' and/or ' SEGRADEQ ' are our response variables.**


```{r}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = SEGRADES, y = FCSCHOOL )) +
  geom_point()
```

**I tried a correlation matrix for all of the variables but it got hard to read. I then looked at the correlation matrix for my variables. It was easier to read but I don't know how useful it was.**


**This took a few minutes to run. While I was running it I remembered we should probably do a training and testing data sets.**


```{r}
s_data <- data[,c(7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,
                  24, 25, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 
                  44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 52, 65, 66, 73)]
```

```{r}

# set seed before random split
set.seed(1)
# put 80% of the data into the training set
school_split <- initial_split(s_data, prop = 0.80)

# assign the two splits to data frames - with descriptive names
school_train <- training(school_split)
school_test <- testing(school_split)

# splits
#school_train
```

```{r}
  lm_spec <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  set_engine("lm")

  lm_spec

  mlr_mod <- lm_spec %>% 
  fit(SEGRADES ~ ., data = s_data)

  tidy(mlr_mod)

```


```{r}
slr_aug <- augment(mlr_mod, new_data = school_test)
slr_aug
```

``` {r}

predict(mlr_mod, new_data = school_test)

```

```{r}

# null model
null_mod <- lm_spec %>% 
fit(SEGRADES ~ 1, data = s_data)

anova(
  extract_fit_engine(null_mod),
  extract_fit_engine(mlr_mod)
)
